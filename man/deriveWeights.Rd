\title{Derive Gene Weights from Bulk RNA-seq Data}
\usage{
deriveWeights(norm, raw = NULL, weight.by.TIL.resid.sd = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{norm}{Matrix of normalized expression (genes × samples, log scale).}

\item{raw}{Optional raw count matrix (not used but retained for compatibility).}

\item{weight.by.TIL.resid.sd}{Logical; if TRUE, emphasize immune-stable genes
(currently disabled for bulk RNA-seq mode).}
}
\value{
A matrix of weights (genes × samples).
}
\description{
Computes per-gene weights for deconvolution by estimating variance across
samples in normalized expression space. More stable genes receive higher
weight during regression.
