\title{Derive Gene Weights from Bulk RNA-seq Data}
\usage{
deriveWeights(
  norm,
  raw = NULL,
  error.model = "bulk",
  weight.by.TIL.resid.sd = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{norm}{Normalized expression matrix (genes x samples)}

\item{raw}{Raw count matrix (genes x samples): optional}

\item{error.model}{Variance model: "quantile" or "loglinear"}
}
\value{
A matrix of weights (genes × samples).
}
\description{
Computes per-gene weights for deconvolution by estimating variance across
samples in normalized expression space. More stable genes receive higher
weight during regression.
