\title{Mapping from granular cell populations to broader cell populations}
\format{
A named list. Each list element corresponds to a broad cell
population, whose value is a character vector of granular sub-populations.

A named list.
}
\usage{
data(safeTME.matches)
}
\description{
This dataset defines how fine-grained single-cell populations map to
broader immune or stromal categories. It is used internally by
\code{convertCellTypes()} to aggregate cell types.

A lookup table mapping fine-grained cell types to broader deconvolution groups.
